## Description
Welcome to our GitHub repository dedicated to Compiler Construction! If you're a curious beginner looking to dive into the world of compiler design, then this repository could be your one-stop resource for learning and practicing the frontend aspect of compiler construction, from scanners, tokenizers to parsers and etc...

**What You'll Find Here:**

1. **Detailed Tutorials:** Our repository houses a series of well-structured tutorials, each focusing on a specific stage of compiler construction. You'll find step-by-step explanations, code examples, and best practices to help you grasp the fundamentals and build a solid foundation.

2. **Hands-On Exercises:** Learning by doing is the key to mastering compiler construction. We provide a rich collection of hands-on exercises and projects, designed to reinforce your understanding of concepts like lexical analysis, parsing, semantic analysis, optimization, and code generation.

3. **Code Samples:** To aid your learning journey, we've included extensive code samples in multiple programming languages. These samples serve as practical implementations of the theoretical concepts discussed in our tutorials, making it easier to apply what you've learned to real-world scenarios.

4. **Comprehensive Coverage:** Our content covers the entire compiler construction process, including lexical analyzers, parsers, semantic analysis, intermediate code generation, optimization techniques, and backend compilation. You'll gain a holistic understanding of how programming languages are processed and transformed into executable code.


Our goal is to give basic knowledge used in the creation of efficient and robust compilers. Compiler construction can be a challenging yet rewarding endeavor, and we're here to support your learning journey every step of the way. Explore, learn, and if possible build your own compilers with us! Feel free to add on the repository and contribute as much as you want.
