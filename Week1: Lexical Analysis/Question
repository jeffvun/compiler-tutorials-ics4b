Lab 1 :
Lexical Analysis

[Due 15th September]


Two part lab:



Design a simple script that takes an English sentence(s) (either static or dynamic) and outputs the individual words. 
E.g. An input can be "He is a smart student". The output will be individual words "He", "is", "a", "smart" and "student". Each word on its own line.

Edit the flex input file, specifying your own rules (patterns and actions). Explain what the resultant lexer from your specification file would do.
